## Usage
Click create a post and type anything into the form. Can edit post by clicking on the post itself then clicking the word edit.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Room for improvement
Could make a user to have their own personal workspace to jot down their own journal entries and add a file upload instead of a url path for images.
  
  Room for improvement
  - Users, login/logout
  - File upload
